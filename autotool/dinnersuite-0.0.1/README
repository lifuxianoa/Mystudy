The Dining Hackers Suite
-------------------------

This package includes four programs:

dinnerd     : the Dining Hackers daemon
libdinner   : library with functions to access the
              daemon
hungryhacker: a simple client for dinnerd
vdinner     : a 3D visualization of the status of
              dinnerd

vdinner requires the X11 windowing system and the
Mesa graphics library.

The protocol is described in dinnerd/DiningHackers.txt

This is an example of aggregating several packages into
one. The NEWS file describes the changes in the
automake/autoconf files.
