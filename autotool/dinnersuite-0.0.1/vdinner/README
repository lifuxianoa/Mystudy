                  --------------

vdinner is a Mesa-based dinnerd status visualization.

You need, to compile it:

- X11
- Mesa
- libdinner

To be usable, you'll want dinnerd and hungryhacker
(which happen to be server and client for the
dining hackers protocol).

The protocol itself is described in the dinnerd
distribution.

Running it:

once you have dinnerd running, run vdinner with

vdinner [-h hostname] [-p clientport]

the clientport is 8081 (the current dinnerd implementation
won't allow other port). If you don't provide a hostname
it will connect to localhost. If you're running the dinnerd
server locally, you may run vdinner without parameters.

Once vdinner is running, you can control the visualization
with the following keys:

ARROWS       - rotate the view
- and =      - zoom (the keys after the zero in the main keyboard)
p            - pause (good for taking screenshots)
f            - print information about framerate
ESC          - exit
1            - toggles shade model SMOOTH / FLAT
2            - alternates between POINT, LINE (wireframe) and
               FILL (normal) modes
3            - toggles use of colors on materials

Guys in red clothes are eating, guys in yellow are not.
The purple "biff" signs mean the guy took a punch
from one of the neighbours

enjoy.
