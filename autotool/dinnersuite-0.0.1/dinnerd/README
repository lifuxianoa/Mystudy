dinnerd
-------

This is dinnerd, an implementation of the dining hackers
protocol. The protocol itself is described in the
DiningHackers.txt file.

For instructions on building dinnerd see the INSTALL file.
This file deals with the syntax for running dinnerd.

Currently the only command line argument dinnerd takes is
--nodaemon:

dinnerd [--nodaemon]

dinnerd will run always listening to ports 8081 and 8082
(8081 is for the client sub-protocol, 8082 for the
watcher sub-protocol).

When run in daemon mode it will only provide output on
errors.

In nodaemon mode you'll be able to see messages for every
connection, request and event that happens.

dinnerd only provides the service. The only current
client implementation is called hungryhacker , it is
distributed in a separate package.

There is also libdinner, a library that provides access
to a dinnerd server without the need to deal directly with
sockets, TCP connections and other details.

And yet, there is vdinner, a Mesa-based 3D visualization
for dinnerd.

This protocol and its associated programs were developed
as examples for a tutorial on the usage os automake,
autoconf and other GNU tools.

Don't take it too seriously.
